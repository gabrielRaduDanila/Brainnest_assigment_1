  <h2>Storyline</h2>
  <p>
    The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family
    in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's
    youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding.
    Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business.
    Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but
    is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous
    rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito
    refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values
    and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most
    reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families
    which could tear the Corleone family apart.
